------------------------------------------Invoice webapp--------------------------------

-> INTRODUCTION
    - used python for this project as im more comfortable with it
    - tried to keep the process as simple as possible by using tools which i thought are best suited for this project
    - instead of focusing only on design ,i wanted to create a basic yet effective design which does the job
    - Happy to see that this webapp works fine without any error

----------------------------------------Libraries used---------------------------------------------------------

-> TKINTER
 -for front end i used tkinter as it's  the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined
    with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented
    interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.
 - tkinter replaced HTML,JS which made the task easier


->  ReportLab
    -to generate  invoice pdf i used ReportLab (An Open Source Python library for generating PDFs and graphics.)
    - tried to make invoice as professional as possible by including img,sig,gts etc


-> smtplib
   -to send email to customer i used smtplib module (it defines an SMTP client session object that can be used to
                                         send mail to any Internet machine with an SMTP)

-> MIME
    -to send pdf i used MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is an extension of the original Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP)
    email protocol. It lets users exchange different kinds of data files, including audio, video, images and application
    programs, over email

-> PANDAS
   -to make dataframe which we get from the user i used PANDAS(it is a Python package that provides fast,
   flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both
   easy and intuitive.
   - to store the data i converted it to CSV file which later can be used accordingly
