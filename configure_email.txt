Make sure you've got the correct smtp address for your email provider:
Gmail: smtp.gmail.com

Hotmail: smtp.live.com

Outlook: outlook.office365.com

Yahoo: smtp.mail.yahoo.com

If you use another email provider, just Google for your email provider e.g. "Gmail SMTP address"

Turn on 2-Step Verification for your email under the Security settings for your account. For example, Manage Your Google Account -> Security.

Add an App Password under your email settings. Select "Other" from the drop-down settings and choose a password. Use this app password in your Python code.
